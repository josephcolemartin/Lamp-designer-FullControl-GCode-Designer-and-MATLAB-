This add-on gives a method for visualizing and easily creating a mathematical function that can be converted into gcode (using full control gcode) and 3d printed into a cool lamp

The recommended workflow is to 1) generate the function for the lampshade in the matlab app, 2) edit (or recreate) the lampshade with holder template in full control gcode 3) copy gcode text into text editor like sublime and save as .gcode 4) check the gcode in something like ideaMaker

NOTE: t_offset generation function in the matlab app IS NOT working right now, so to align the lamp holder to the creases will take some trial and error
