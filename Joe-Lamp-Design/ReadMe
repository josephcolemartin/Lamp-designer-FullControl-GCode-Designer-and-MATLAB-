This add-on gives a method for visualizing and easily creating a mathematical function that can be converted into gcode (using full control gcode) and 3d printed into a cool lamp

The recommended workflow is to 1) generate the function for the lampshade in the matlab app, 2) edit (or recreate) the lampshade with holder template in full control gcode 3) copy gcode text into text editor like sublime and save as .gcode 4) check the gcode in something like ideaMaker

NOTE: t_offset generation is a trial and error method
NOTE 2: if you're using the excel template I included and are including a lamp holder make sure when you change the function in the x part of the line equation you remove 'Tval' from the matlab generated function since we are looking at the Tval=0 position of that function. The holder equation uses a different Tval 
g'd luck!
