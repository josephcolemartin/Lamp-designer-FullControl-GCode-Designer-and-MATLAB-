This add-on gives a method for visualizing and easily creating a mathematical function that can be converted into gcode (using full control gcode) and 3d printed into a cool lamp

NOTE: t_offset generation function in the matlab app IS NOT working right now, so to align the lamp holder to the creases will take some trial and error

If you have any questions shoot me a question at jcm047@ucsd.edu
